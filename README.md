   # tilegenx

Procedural tile generation for 2D games based on **Unity Tilemaps**.

This repository is part of a series of projects intended to investigate procedural content generation for videogames.

**tilegenx is currently under development. Bugs may occur, the actual state of the project it's not representative of the final development. For now It's not recommendable use tilegenx on a started project. Feel free to provide feedback and bug issues.**

   # What is tilegenx?

**tilegenx** is an add-on API for **Unity Tilemaps**, that bring some powerfull tools to create easy procedural simulations and distributions able to be layered and multigenerated. Create parametreable random pattern geometries usefull to create structures, render only the necessary tiles, assign tiles procedurally, auto-wall generation and much more.
